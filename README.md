# Newsman

is a customizable, self-hostable alternative to [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)

> **How does it work?**
> Newsman works as a web-scraper, but not directly, it uses [DracoQL](https://github.com/aadv1k/dracoql) which is a query language built to web scrape, to store a declerative file for each site to be scraped. This makes the system modular and customizable
